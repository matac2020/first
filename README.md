# 1-Project Motivation

I’m Ata, working for South Capital, one of Argentina’s largest asset management companies. 

Our company purchases the non-performing loans of the banks through auctions and collects them from the borrowers.

My goal is to show the effect of macroeconomic indicators on NPL (non performing loan) collections.

I have always thought that the impact of the macro economic indicators on debt collection is greater than we assume.

My study using Python shows that the impact is more than I thought.

# 2-File Descriptions

There is one notebook which i did EDA and regression model.

In the notebook, there are 3 different data tables needed to run the model. 

After EDA and preprocessing, those tables are being merged.

Explanations are available before each important code row.
